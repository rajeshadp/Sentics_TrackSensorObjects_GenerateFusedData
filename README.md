Headers used and purpose
==========================
iostream / fstream → Handles input/output operations, including file reading/writing.
vector → Used for storing sensor objects, IMU data, and clusters.
cmath → Provides mathematical functions (not explicitly used here).
nlohmann/json.hpp → A JSON library used to parse sensor data from JSON files.
fast-cpp-csv-parser/csv.h → A high-performance CSV parser used for reading IMU data.
Eigen/Dense → Provides matrix operations for implementing the Kalman filter.

This program reads sensor data, tracks objects using a Kalman filter, and fuses the data with IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) readings to generate a refined dataset. Finally, it writes the fused data to a CSV file.

**Key Steps:**
Read Sensor Data (JSON) – Loads object positions from a sensor file.
Read IMU Data (CSV) – Loads IMU readings (e.g., heading, state).
Track Objects (Kalman Filter) – Uses a Kalman filter to smooth object positions and estimate movement.
Fuse Data – Combines object positions with IMU data based on timestamps.
Save to CSV – Writes the processed and fused data for further analysis.
This helps reduce sensor noise, track moving objects more accurately, and correlate sensor data with IMU readings for better insights.

Compile & execute:
==================
I used debian WSL on windows 11 pro, where other input files task_cam_data.json, task_imu.csv are also placed along with fusion.cpp file with business logic:
g++ -std=c++17 fusion.cpp -o fusion -I ../tempInstall/ -I /usr/include/eigen3
./fusion
